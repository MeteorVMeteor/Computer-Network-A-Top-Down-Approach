1. What are the SSIDs of the two access points that are issuing most of the beacon frames in this trace?  
Tag: SSID parameter set: 30 Munroe St
Tag: SSID parameter set: linksys12

2. What are the intervals of time between the transmissions of the beacon frames the linksys_ses_24086 access point? From the 30 Munroe St. access point? (Hint: this  interval of time is contained in the beacon frame itself). 
linksys_ses_24086: Beacon Interval: 0.102400 [Seconds]
30 Munroe St: Beacon Interval: 0.102400 [Seconds]

3. What (in hexadecimal notation) is the source MAC address on the beacon frame from 30 Munroe St? Recall from Figure 7.13 in the text that the source,  destination, and BSS are three addresses used in an 802.11 frame. For a detailed  discussion of the 802.11 frame structure, see section 7 in the IEEE 802.11  standards document (cited above). 
Transmitter address: Cisco-Li_f7:1d:51 (00:16:b6:f7:1d:51)
Destination address: Broadcast (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff)
BSS Id: Cisco-Li_f7:1d:51 (00:16:b6:f7:1d:51)
AP Mac Address will become the Mac address of the whole BSS.

4. What (in hexadecimal notation) is the destination MAC address on the beacon frame from 30 Munroe St?? 
see question 3

5. What (in hexadecimal notation) is the MAC BSS id on the beacon frame from 30 Munroe St?  
see question 3

6. The beacon frames from the 30 Munroe St access point advertise that the access  point can support four data rates and eight additional “extended supported rates.” What are these rates? 
Tag: Supported Rates 1(B), 2(B), 5.5(B), 11(B), [Mbit/sec]
Tag: Extended Supported Rates 6(B), 9, 12(B), 18, 24(B), 36, 48, 54, [Mbit/sec]
