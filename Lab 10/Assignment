1. What are the SSIDs of the two access points that are issuing most of the beacon frames in this trace?  
Tag: SSID parameter set: 30 Munroe St
Tag: SSID parameter set: linksys12

2. What are the intervals of time between the transmissions of the beacon frames the linksys_ses_24086 access point? From the 30 Munroe St. access point? (Hint: this  interval of time is contained in the beacon frame itself). 
linksys_ses_24086: Beacon Interval: 0.102400 [Seconds]
30 Munroe St: Beacon Interval: 0.102400 [Seconds]

3. What (in hexadecimal notation) is the source MAC address on the beacon frame from 30 Munroe St? Recall from Figure 7.13 in the text that the source,  destination, and BSS are three addresses used in an 802.11 frame. For a detailed  discussion of the 802.11 frame structure, see section 7 in the IEEE 802.11  standards document (cited above). 
Transmitter address: Cisco-Li_f7:1d:51 (00:16:b6:f7:1d:51)
Destination address: Broadcast (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff)
BSS Id: Cisco-Li_f7:1d:51 (00:16:b6:f7:1d:51)
First-hop router is AP.

4. What (in hexadecimal notation) is the destination MAC address on the beacon frame from 30 Munroe St?? 
see question 3

5. What (in hexadecimal notation) is the MAC BSS id on the beacon frame from 30 Munroe St?  
see question 3

6. The beacon frames from the 30 Munroe St access point advertise that the access  point can support four data rates and eight additional “extended supported rates.” What are these rates? 
Tag: Supported Rates 1(B), 2(B), 5.5(B), 11(B), [Mbit/sec]
Tag: Extended Supported Rates 6(B), 9, 12(B), 18, 24(B), 36, 48, 54, [Mbit/sec]

7. Find the 802.11 frame containing the SYN TCP segment for this first TCP session  (that downloads alice.txt). What are three MAC address fields in the 802.11frame? Which MAC address in this frame corresponds to the wireless host (give  the hexadecimal representation of the MAC address for the host)? To the access  point? To the first-hop router? What is the IP address of the wireless host  sending this TCP segment? What is the destination IP address? Does this  destination IP address correspond to the host, access point, first-hop router, or  some other network-attached device? Explain.

wireless host: Source address: IntelCor_d1:b6:4f (00:13:02:d1:b6:4f)

First-hop router: Destination address: Cisco-Li_f4:eb:a8 (00:16:b6:f4:eb:a8) (Destination is different with Reciver address).

No, this is the server of http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/alice.txt

8. Find the 802.11 frame containing the SYNACK segment for this TCP session.  What are three MAC address fields in the 802.11 frame? Which MAC address in  this frame corresponds to the host? To the access point? To the first-hop router?  Does the sender MAC address in the frame correspond to the IP address of the  device that sent the TCP segment encapsulated within this datagram? (Hint:  review Figure 6.19 in the text if you are unsure of how to answer this question, or  the corresponding part of the previous question. It’s particularly important that  you understand this). 
First-hop / Wireless host: Destination address: 91:2a:b0:49:b6:4f (91:2a:b0:49:b6:4f)
AP: BSS Id: Cisco-Li_f7:1d:51 (00:16:b6:f7:1d:51)
Source address: Cisco-Li_f4:eb:a8 (00:16:b6:f4:eb:a8)
It should not be.

9. What two actions are taken (i.e., frames are sent) by the host in the trace just after  t=49, to end the association with the 30 Munroe St AP that was initially in place  when trace collection began? (Hint: one is an IP-layer action, and one is an  802.11-layer action). Looking at the 802.11 specification, is there another frame  that you might have expected to see, but don’t see here? 
1733	49.583615	192.168.1.109	192.168.1.1	DHCP	390	DHCP Release  - Transaction ID 0xea5a526
1735	49.609617	IntelCor_d1:b6:4f	Cisco-Li_f7:1d:51	802.11	54	Deauthentication, SN=1605, FN=0, Flags=........C
Type/Subtype: Deauthentication (0x000c)
Disassociation(001010) also can quit the connnection.

10. Examine the trace file and look for AUTHENICATION frames sent from the host  to an AP and vice versa. How many AUTHENTICATION messages are sent  from the wireless host to the linksys_ses_24086 AP (which has a MAC address of  Cisco_Li_f5:ba:bb) starting at around t=49? .  
First: 1740	49.638857	IntelCor_d1:b6:4f	Cisco-Li_f5:ba:bb	802.11	58	Authentication, SN=1606, FN=0, Flags=........C
and 5 times retransmitted.
6(pic1)

11. Does the host want the authentication to require a key or be open? 
Authentication Algorithm: Open System (0)

12. Do you see a reply AUTHENTICATION from the linksys_ses_24086 AP in the  trace? 
1736	49.609770		IntelCor_d1:b6:4f (00:13:02:d1:b6:4f) (RA)	802.11	38	Acknowledgement, Flags=........C
Only ack, but no reply AUTHENTICATION, may beacuse there are no key with the AUTHENTICATION

13. Now let’s consider what happens as the host gives up trying to associate with the  linksys_ses_24086 AP and now tries to associate with the 30 Munroe St AP. Look  for AUTHENICATION frames sent from the host to and AP and vice versa. At  what times are there an AUTHENTICATION frame from the host to the 30  Munroe St. AP, and when is there a reply AUTHENTICATION sent from that AP  to the host in reply? (Note that you can use the filter expression “wlan.fc.subtype  == 11and wlan.fc.type == 0 and wlan.addr == IntelCor_d1:b6:4f” to display only  the AUTHENTICATION frames in this trace for this wireless host.)
2156	63.168087	IntelCor_d1:b6:4f	Cisco-Li_f7:1d:51	802.11	58	Authentication, SN=1647, FN=0, Flags=........C

14. An ASSOCIATE REQUEST from host to AP, and a corresponding ASSOCIATE  RESPONSE frame from AP to host are used for the host to associated with an AP.  At what time is there an ASSOCIATE REQUEST from host to the 30 Munroe St AP? When is the corresponding ASSOCIATE REPLY sent? (Note that you can  use the filter expression “wlan.fc.subtype < 2 and wlan.fc.type == 0 and  wlan.addr == IntelCor_d1:b6:4f” to display only the ASSOCIATE REQUEST  and ASSOCIATE RESPONSE frames for this trace.) 
2162	63.169910	IntelCor_d1:b6:4f	Cisco-Li_f7:1d:51	802.11	89	Association Request, SN=1648, FN=0, Flags=........C, SSID=30 Munroe St
2166	63.192101	Cisco-Li_f7:1d:51	IntelCor_d1:b6:4f	802.11	94	Association Response, SN=3728, FN=0, Flags=........C

15. What transmission rates is the host willing to use? The AP? To answer this  question, you will need to look into the parameters fields of the 802.11 wireless  LAN management frame. 
Tag: Supported Rates 1(B), 2(B), 5.5(B), 11(B), 6(B), 9, 12(B), 18, [Mbit/sec]
Tag: Extended Supported Rates 24(B), 36, 48, 54, [Mbit/sec]
BSS Id: Cisco-Li_f7:1d:51 (00:16:b6:f7:1d:51)

16. What are the sender, receiver and BSS ID MAC addresses in these frames? What  is the purpose of these two types of frames? (To answer this last question, you’ll  need to dig into the online references cited earlier in this lab).
2152	63.140106	IntelCor_d1:b6:4f	Broadcast	802.11	94	Probe Request, SN=1647, FN=0, Flags=........C, SSID=30 Munroe St
