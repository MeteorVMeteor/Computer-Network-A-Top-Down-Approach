1. What are the SSIDs of the two access points that are issuing most of the beacon frames in this trace?  
Tag: SSID parameter set: 30 Munroe St
Tag: SSID parameter set: linksys12

2. What are the intervals of time between the transmissions of the beacon frames the linksys_ses_24086 access point? From the 30 Munroe St. access point? (Hint: this  interval of time is contained in the beacon frame itself). 
linksys_ses_24086: Beacon Interval: 0.102400 [Seconds]
30 Munroe St: Beacon Interval: 0.102400 [Seconds]

3. What (in hexadecimal notation) is the source MAC address on the beacon frame from 30 Munroe St? Recall from Figure 7.13 in the text that the source,  destination, and BSS are three addresses used in an 802.11 frame. For a detailed  discussion of the 802.11 frame structure, see section 7 in the IEEE 802.11  standards document (cited above). 
Transmitter address: Cisco-Li_f7:1d:51 (00:16:b6:f7:1d:51)
Destination address: Broadcast (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff)
BSS Id: Cisco-Li_f7:1d:51 (00:16:b6:f7:1d:51)
First-hop router is AP.

4. What (in hexadecimal notation) is the destination MAC address on the beacon frame from 30 Munroe St?? 
see question 3

5. What (in hexadecimal notation) is the MAC BSS id on the beacon frame from 30 Munroe St?  
see question 3

6. The beacon frames from the 30 Munroe St access point advertise that the access  point can support four data rates and eight additional “extended supported rates.” What are these rates? 
Tag: Supported Rates 1(B), 2(B), 5.5(B), 11(B), [Mbit/sec]
Tag: Extended Supported Rates 6(B), 9, 12(B), 18, 24(B), 36, 48, 54, [Mbit/sec]

7. Find the 802.11 frame containing the SYN TCP segment for this first TCP session  (that downloads alice.txt). What are three MAC address fields in the 802.11frame? Which MAC address in this frame corresponds to the wireless host (give  the hexadecimal representation of the MAC address for the host)? To the access  point? To the first-hop router? What is the IP address of the wireless host  sending this TCP segment? What is the destination IP address? Does this  destination IP address correspond to the host, access point, first-hop router, or  some other network-attached device? Explain.

wireless host: Source address: IntelCor_d1:b6:4f (00:13:02:d1:b6:4f)

First-hop router: Destination address: Cisco-Li_f4:eb:a8 (00:16:b6:f4:eb:a8) (Destination is different with Reciver address).

No, this is the server of http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/alice.txt

8. Find the 802.11 frame containing the SYNACK segment for this TCP session.  What are three MAC address fields in the 802.11 frame? Which MAC address in  this frame corresponds to the host? To the access point? To the first-hop router?  Does the sender MAC address in the frame correspond to the IP address of the  device that sent the TCP segment encapsulated within this datagram? (Hint:  review Figure 6.19 in the text if you are unsure of how to answer this question, or  the corresponding part of the previous question. It’s particularly important that  you understand this). 
First-hop / Wireless host: Destination address: 91:2a:b0:49:b6:4f (91:2a:b0:49:b6:4f)
AP: BSS Id: Cisco-Li_f7:1d:51 (00:16:b6:f7:1d:51)
Source address: Cisco-Li_f4:eb:a8 (00:16:b6:f4:eb:a8)
It should not be.
