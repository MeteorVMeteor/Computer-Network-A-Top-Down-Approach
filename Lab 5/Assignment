1. Select the first ICMP Echo Request message sent by your computer, and expand the Internet Protocol part of the packet in the packet details window. What is the IP address of your computer? 
8	6.163045	192.168.1.102	128.59.23.100	ICMP	98	Echo (ping) request  id=0x0300, seq=20483/848, ttl=1 (no response found!)

2. Within the IP packet header, what is the value in the upper layer protocol field? 
Protocol: ICMP (1)

3. How many bytes are in the IP header? How many bytes are in the payload of the IP datagram? Explain how you determined the number of payload bytes. 
.... 0101 = Header Length: 20 bytes (5)
Total Length: 84 - 20 = 64bytes

4. Has this IP datagram been fragmented? Explain how you determined whether or not the datagram has been fragmented.
...0 0000 0000 0000 = Fragment Offset: 0
.0.. .... = Don't fragment: Not set

5. Which fields in the IP datagram always change from one datagram to the next within this series of ICMP messages sent by your computer? 
Sequence Number changed every time

6. Which fields stay constant? Which of the fields must stay constant? Which fields must change? Why? 
Data and Type and Code stay constant, type and code must constant, sequence number and Identifier and checksum have to change.
Because sequence number and identifier make them different with other Echo Request, checksum change because seq and id change.

7. Describe the pattern you see in the values in the Identification field of the IP datagram 
Identification plus 1 in each IP datagram.

8. What is the value in the Identification field and the TTL field? 
Identification: 0xa60b (42507)
Time to Live: 244

9. Do these values remain unchanged for all of the ICMP TTL-exceeded replies sent to your computer by the nearest (first hop) router? Why? 
ALL changed
Because each IP packet has to have unique ID.
If id not changed will means that they are fragments from a same big IP packet.
If TTL not changed it may means that is answer for retransmition from client, or they are fragments from a same big IP packet.

10. Find the first ICMP Echo Request message that was sent by your computer after you changed the Packet Size in pingplotter to be 2000. Has that message been fragmented across more than one IP datagram? 
yes

11. Print out the first fragment of the fragmented IP datagram. What information in the IP header indicates that the datagram been fragmented? What information in the IP header indicates whether this is the first fragment versus a latter fragment? How long is this IP datagram? 
Flags: 0x20, More fragments
...0 0000 0000 0000 = Fragment Offset: 0
Data (1480 bytes) + .... 0101 = Header Length: 20 bytes (5) = Total Length: 1500

12. Print out the second fragment of the fragmented IP datagram. What information in the IP header indicates that this is not the first datagram fragment? Are the more fragments? How can you tell? 
...0 0101 1100 1000 = Fragment Offset: 1480
Flags: 0x00  -> NO More fragments
Because I also checked next ipv4 datagram, and Identification changed.

13. What fields change in the IP header between the first and second fragment? 
Flags, Fragment Offset, Header Checksum, Total Length

14. How many fragments were created from the original datagram? 
3

15. What fields change in the IP header among the fragments?
Flags, Fragment Offset, Header Checksum, Total Length
