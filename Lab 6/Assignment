1. What is the IP address of the client? 
2	1.124897	192.168.1.100	68.87.71.230	DNS	91	Standard query 0xa9a9 A safebrowsing.clients.google.com

2. The client actually communicates with several different Google servers in order to implement “safe browsing.” (See extra credit section at the end of this lab). The main Google server that will serve up the main Google web page has IP address 64.233.169.104. In order to display only those frames containing HTTP messages that are sent to/from this Google, server, enter the expression “http && ip.addr == 64.233.169.104” (without quotes) into the Filter: field in Wireshark . 

3. Consider now the HTTP GET sent from the client to the Google server (whose IP address is IP address 64.233.169.104) at time 7.109267. What are the source and destination IP addresses and TCP source and destination ports on the IP datagram carrying this HTTP GET? 
56	7.109267	192.168.1.100	64.233.169.104	HTTP	689	GET / HTTP/1.1 
Transmission Control Protocol, Src Port: 4335, Dst Port: 80, Seq: 1, Ack: 1, Len: 635

4. At what time is the corresponding 200 OK HTTP message received from the Google server? What are the source and destination IP addresses and TCP source and destination ports on the IP datagram carrying this HTTP 200 OK message? 
60	7.158797	64.233.169.104	192.168.1.100	HTTP	814	HTTP/1.1 200 OK  (text/html)
Transmission Control Protocol, Src Port: 80, Dst Port: 4335, Seq: 2861, Ack: 636, Len: 760

5. Recall that before a GET command can be sent to an HTTP server, TCP must first set up a connection using the three-way SYN/ACK handshake. At what time is the client-to-server TCP SYN segment sent that sets up the connection used by the GET sent at time 7.109267? What are the source and destination IP addresses and source and destination ports for the TCP SYN segment? What are the source and destination IP addresses and source and destination ports of the ACK sent in response to the SYN. At what time is this ACK received at the client? (Note: to find these segments you will need to clear the Filter expression you entered above in step 2. If you enter the filter “tcp”, only TCP segments will be displayed by Wireshark). 
53	7.075657	192.168.1.100	64.233.169.104	TCP	66	4335 → 80 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=65535 Len=0 MSS=1460 WS=4 SACK_PERM=1
54	7.108986	64.233.169.104	192.168.1.100	TCP	66	80 → 4335 [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=5720 Len=0 MSS=1430 SACK_PERM=1 WS=64

6. In the NAT_ISP_side trace file, find the HTTP GET message was sent from the client to the Google server at time 7.109267 (where t=7.109267 is time at which this was sent as recorded in the NAT_home_side trace file). At what time does this message appear in the NAT_ISP_side trace file? What are the source and destination IP addresses and TCP source and destination ports on the IP datagram carrying this HTTP GET (as recording in the NAT_ISP_side trace file)? Which of these fields are the same, and which are different, than in your answer to question 3 above? 
85	6.069168	71.192.34.104	64.233.169.104	HTTP	689	GET / HTTP/1.1 
Transmission Control Protocol, Src Port: 4335, Dst Port: 80, Seq: 1, Ack: 1, Len: 635
Source IP Address is different, IP destination and TCP source , destination are same.

7. Are any fields in the HTTP GET message changed? Which of the following fields in the IP datagram carrying the HTTP GET are changed: Version, Header Length, Flags, Checksum. If any of these fields have changed, give a reason (in one sentence) stating why this field needed to change. 
Header Checksum: 0xa94a [validation disabled]
Header Checksum: 0x022f [validation disabled]
version, header length, flags, all same
chechsum change because of the change of Source IP address.

8. In the NAT_ISP_side trace file, at what time is the first 200 OK HTTP message received from the Google server? What are the source and destination IP addresses and TCP source and destination ports on the IP datagram carrying this HTTP 200 OK message? Which of these fields are the same, and which are different than your answer to question 4 above? 
90	6.117570	64.233.169.104	71.192.34.104	HTTP	814	HTTP/1.1 200 OK  (text/html)
Transmission Control Protocol, Src Port: 80, Dst Port: 4335, Seq: 2861, Ack: 636, Len: 760
Destination of IP address changed.

9. In the NAT_ISP_side trace file, at what time were the client-to-server TCP SYN segment and the server-to-client TCP ACK segment corresponding to the segments in question 5 above captured? What are the source and destination IP addresses and source and destination ports for these two segments? Which of these fields are the same, and which are different than your answer to question 5 above? 
82	6.035475	71.192.34.104	64.233.169.104	TCP	66	4335 → 80 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=65535 Len=0 MSS=1460 WS=4 SACK_PERM=1
83	6.067775	64.233.169.104	71.192.34.104	TCP	66	80 → 4335 [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=5720 Len=0 MSS=1430 SACK_PERM=1 WS=64
time between syn and ack are different
Home: [Time since previous frame in this TCP stream: 0.033329000 seconds]
IPS: [Time since previous frame in this TCP stream: 0.032300000 seconds]

10. Using your answers to 1-8 above, fill in the NAT translation table entries for HTTP connection considered in questions 1-8 above. 
Local IP Address: 192.168.1.100 source port: 4335  = Intenet IP Address: 71.192.34.104 source port: 4335 

Extra Credit: The trace files investigated above have additional connections to Google servers above and beyond the HTTP GET, 200 OK request/response studied above. For example, in the NAT_home_side trace file, consider the client-to-server GET at time 
1.572315, and the GET at time 7.573305. Research the use of these two HTTP messages and write a half page explanation of the purpose of each of these messages.
