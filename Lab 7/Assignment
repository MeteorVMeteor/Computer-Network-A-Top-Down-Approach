1. Are DHCP messages sent over UDP or TCP?  
User Datagram Protocol, Src Port: 68, Dst Port: 67

2. Draw a timing datagram illustrating the sequence of the first four-packet  Discover/Offer/Request/ACK DHCP exchange between the client and server. For  each packet, indicate the source and destination port numbers. Are the port  numbers the same as in the example given in this lab assignment?  
Discover: 68 -> 67
Offer: 67 -> 68
Request: 68 -> 67
ACK: 67 -> 68

3. What is the link-layer (e.g., Ethernet) address of your host? 
Ethernet II, Src: RivetNet_d6:4a:63 (9c:b6:d0:d6:4a:63), Dst: Broadcast (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff)

4. What values in the DHCP discover message differentiate this message from the DHCP request message? 
Option: (53) DHCP Message Type (Request)
Option: (53) DHCP Message Type (Discover)

5. What is the value of the Transaction-ID in each of the first four (Discover/Offer/Request/ACK) DHCP messages? What are the values of the  Transaction-ID in the second set (Request/ACK) set of DHCP messages? What is  the purpose of the Transaction-ID field? 
Transaction ID: 0x95f1a3b7
Transaction ID: 0x56670a9a
show that messages are same stream or not

6. A host uses DHCP to obtain an IP address, among other things. But a host’s IP  address is not confirmed until the end of the four-message exchange! If the IP  address is not set until the end of the four-message exchange, then what values are  used in the IP datagrams in the four-message exchange? For each of the four  DHCP messages (Discover/Offer/Request/ACK DHCP), indicate the source and  destination IP addresses that are carried in the encapsulating IP datagram. 
Use 0.0.0.0 for DHCP client's source
59	6.805002	0.0.0.0	255.255.255.255	DHCP	344	DHCP Discover - Transaction ID 0x95f1a3b7
63	7.179660	10.58.97.126	255.255.255.255	DHCP	342	DHCP Offer    - Transaction ID 0x95f1a3b7
64	7.180613	0.0.0.0	255.255.255.255	DHCP	370	DHCP Request  - Transaction ID 0x95f1a3b7
73	7.767818	10.58.97.126	255.255.255.255	DHCP	342	DHCP ACK      - Transaction ID 0x95f1a3b7

7. What is the IP address of your DHCP server? 
DHCP Server Identifier: 10.7.128.254

8. What IP address is the DHCP server offering to your host in the DHCP Offer  message? Indicate which DHCP message contains the offered DHCP address. 
Your (client) IP address: 10.58.97.5
Option: (53) DHCP Message Type (Offer)

9. In the example screenshot in this assignment, there is no relay agent between the host and the DHCP server. What values in the trace indicate the absence of a relay  agent? Is there a relay agent in your experiment? If so what is the IP address of  the agent? 
Router: 10.58.97.126
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.128

10. Explain the purpose of the router and subnet mask lines in the DHCP offer message. 
let client get default gateway

11. In the DHCP trace file noted in footnote 2, the DHCP server offers a specific IP  address to the client (see also question 8. above). In the client’s response to the first server OFFER message, does the client accept this IP address? Where in the  client’s RESPONSE is the client’s requested address? 
accept
Option: (50) Requested IP Address (192.168.1.101)
Option: (53) DHCP Message Type (Request)

12. Explain the purpose of the lease time. How long is the lease time in your  experiment?
IP Address Lease Time: (600s) 10 minutes
Releasing IP address which is not be using.

13. What is the purpose of the DHCP release message? Does the DHCP server issue an acknowledgment of receipt of the client’s DHCP request? What would happen  if the client’s DHCP release message is lost? 
release IP address, No response(ACK) to client, IP address will be release until the IP Address Lease Time.

14. Clear the bootp filter from your Wireshark window. Were any ARP packets sent  or received during the DHCP packet-exchange period? If so, explain the purpose  of those ARP packets.
