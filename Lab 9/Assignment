[Note: this is an important question, and one that students  sometimes get wrong. Re-read pages 468-469 in the text and make sure you  understand the answer here.] 
3. Give the hexadecimal value for the two-byte Frame type field. What upper layer  protocol does this correspond to? 
4. How many bytes from the very start of the Ethernet frame does the ASCII “G” in  “GET” appear in the Ethernet frame?
