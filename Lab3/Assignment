1.What is the IP address and TCP port number used by the client computer (source) that is transferring the file to gaia.cs.umass.edu? To answer this question, it’s probably easiest to select an HTTP message and explore the details of the TCP packet used to carry this HTTP message, using the “details of the selected packet header window” (refer to Figure 2 in the “Getting Started with Wireshark” Lab if you’re uncertain about the Wireshark windows.
10.58.97.5	128.119.245.12	TCP	66	59092 → 80 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460 WS=256 SACK_PERM=1
10.58.97.5 58982

2. What is the IP address of gaia.cs.umass.edu? On what port number is it sending and receiving TCP segments for this connection? 
128.119.245.12  80

3. What is the IP address and TCP port number used by your client computer (source) to transfer the file to gaia.cs.umass.edu? 
10.58.97.5 58982

4. What is the sequence number of the TCP SYN segment that is used to initiate the TCP connection between the client computer and gaia.cs.umass.edu? What is it in the segment that identifies the segment as a SYN segment? 
Sequence Number (raw): 35123972
Flags: 0x002 (SYN)

5. What is the sequence number of the SYNACK segment sent by gaia.cs.umass.edu to the client computer in reply to the SYN? What is the value of the Acknowledgement field in the SYNACK segment? How did gaia.cs.umass.edu determine that value? What is it in the segment that identifies the segment as a SYNACK segment? 
Sequence Number (raw): 2925487862
Acknowledgment number (raw): 35123973
SYN : [Next Sequence Number: 1    (relative sequence number)]
Flags: 0x012 (SYN, ACK)

6. What is the sequence number of the TCP segment containing the HTTP POST command? Note that in order to find the POST command, you’ll need to dig into the packet content field at the bottom of the Wireshark window, looking for a segment with a “POST” within its DATA field. 
Sequence Number (raw): 35123973
50 4f 53 54 20 2f 77 69 ……
POST /wireshark-labs/lab3-1-reply.htm HTTP/1.1

7. Consider the TCP segment containing the HTTP POST as the first segment in the TCP connection. What are the sequence numbers of the first six segments in the TCP connection (including the segment containing the HTTP POST)? At what time was each segment sent? When was the ACK for each segment received? Given the difference between when each TCP segment was sent, and when its acknowledgement was received, what is the RTT value for each of the six segments? What is the EstimatedRTT value (see Section 3.5.3, page 242 in text) after the receipt of each ACK? Assume that the value of the EstimatedRTT is equal to the measured RTT for the first segment, and then is computed using the EstimatedRTT equation on page 242 for all subsequent segments.
